# Pinball

Pinball is a pinball and breakout mashup created in Unity featuring a reversible gravity mechanic.

This is a project for CTIN-484 and CTIN-489 at the University of Southern California.

## Controls

`Z` and `/` = Paddles

`Space` = Plungers

`Left Arrow Key` and `Right Arrow Key` = Tilt (very subtle, for use ONLY when you get stuck!)
